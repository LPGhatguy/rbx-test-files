# cframe-special-cases
* Roblox Studio version: 0.452.2.413165

Contains 24 `CFrameValue` objects. Each one corresponds to one of the special orientation IDs in the binary format, and is named after that ID. For more information see the [CFrame specification](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rbx-dom/blob/master/format/binary.md#cframe) in rbx-dom.

This test file is really only useful for testing implementations of the binary format, but an xml file is included for completion.
